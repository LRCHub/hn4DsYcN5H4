Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
Show me how, decide what you want from me
Tell me maybe I could be there for you

Back to life, back to the present time
Back from a fantasy
Yeah tell me now, take the initiative
I'll leave it in your hands until you're ready

However do you want me
However do you need me
How, however do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me

Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
I live at the top of the block
No more room for trouble or fuss
Need a change, a positive change
Look it's me writing on the wall

However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
