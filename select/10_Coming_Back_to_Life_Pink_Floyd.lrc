[01:28.38] Where were you when I was burned and broken?
[01:40.99] While the days slipped by from my window watching
[01:51.95] And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless?
[02:05.50] 'Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me
[02:15.81] While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
[02:23.10] Dying to believe in what you heard
[02:28.21] I was staring straight into the shining sun
[02:49.71] 
[02:44.53] Lost in thought and lost in time
[02:55.31] While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
[03:06.04] Outside, the rain fell dark and slow
[03:17.06] While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
[03:27.40] I took a heavenly ride through our silence
[03:32.83] I knew the moment had arrived
[03:38.62] For killing the past and coming back to life
[04:00.62] 
[04:32.75] I took a heavenly ride through our silence
[04:38.42] I knew the waiting had begun
[04:43.77] And headed straight into the shining sun
