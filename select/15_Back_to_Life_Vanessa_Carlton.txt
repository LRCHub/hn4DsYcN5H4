Lying in the dark, waiting patiently
Pill like a diamond, putting me to sleep
Black swan, I've become
I want to know no one
Bring me a stranger
On the eve of renaissance

Pendulum above my body swings
Know that I'm a living breathing thing
Slowly see the color in my eyes
Back to life, back to life

Waiting, hungry, a bird upon the sea
Under navy, the craving comes for me
Wait it out, it's different now
The power's coming slowly
Touch my skin, it's delicate
I can feel the change

Pendulum above my body swings
Know that I'm a living breathing thing
Slowly see the color in my eyes
Back to life, back to life
Back to...

Sight, sound
Touch me to find
Bad, good
Dead, alive
Slowly see the color in my eyes
Back to life, back to life

Pendulum above my body swings
Know that I'm a living breathing thing
Slowly see the color in my eyes
Back to life, back to life
Back to...
